# Employee Attrition Analysis Project 

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the Employee Attrition Analysis project. The project focuses on understanding the factors contributing to employee attrition within an organization. It involves data loading, data cleaning, data analysis, and the application of various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, logistic regression with class imbalance handling, decision trees, feature selection, random forest, and AdaBoost.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several main components:
1. **Data Loading:** The project begins by loading the employee attrition data into a Jupyter Notebook or other suitable environment.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning is performed to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset. This step ensures that the data is suitable for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the employee attrition dataset. This includes identifying trends, patterns, and relationships among various attributes.

4. **Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression is applied to model the relationship between employee attributes and the likelihood of attrition.

5. **Logistic Regression with Class Imbalance Handling:** If class imbalance exists in the target variable, techniques for handling class imbalance, such as oversampling or undersampling, may be applied to improve model performance.

6. **Decision Trees:** Decision tree algorithms are used to build predictive models for attrition, providing insights into which factors are most influential.

7. **Feature Selection:** Feature selection techniques are applied to identify and select the most relevant attributes for attrition prediction, improving model efficiency.

8. **Random Forest:** Random forest, an ensemble learning technique, is used to build a more robust and accurate attrition prediction model.

9. **AdaBoost:** AdaBoost, another ensemble method, is applied to further enhance the predictive power of the model.
